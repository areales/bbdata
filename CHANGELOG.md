# Changelog

All notable changes to `bbdata` are documented here. This project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 0.9.0 — 2026-04-19

**Breaking:** removes the module-singleton `stdinAdapter` to eliminate
cross-call state leakage that affected programmatic library consumers
(scout-app via `src/lib/prefetch.ts`, course tooling). Source: Codex
senior-eng review item R1.3 in `TASKS.md`. CLI surface (flags, args,
output schema) is unchanged.

### Migration

Only affects code that imports stdin-adapter helpers directly. CLI users
(`bbdata query --stdin …`, `bbdata report --data …`, `bbdata viz …`)
see no change.

```diff
- import { getStdinAdapter, resolveAdapters } from 'bbdata';
+ import { createStdinAdapter, resolveAdapters } from 'bbdata';

- const adapter = getStdinAdapter();
- adapter.load(raw);
+ const adapter = createStdinAdapter();
+ adapter.load(raw);

- resolveAdapters(['stdin']);
+ resolveAdapters(['stdin'], { stdin: adapter });
```

`loadDataFile(path)` now **returns** the loaded `StdinAdapter`:

```diff
- loadDataFile('./payload.csv');
- const adapter = getStdinAdapter();
+ const adapter = loadDataFile('./payload.csv');
```

When calling `query()` / `report()` / `viz()` programmatically from a
parent command, thread a pre-loaded adapter via the new
`stdinAdapter` option so sibling sub-calls share the same payload
without re-reading stdin (stdin is consumable exactly once per process).

### Changed

- **`src/adapters/index.ts`** — module-scope `stdinAdapter` singleton
  removed; `'stdin'` dropped from the static adapter record;
  `getStdinAdapter()` replaced by a `createStdinAdapter()` factory;
  `resolveAdapters(preferred, overrides?)` accepts a per-call override
  map so stdin flows through the same resolution path as network
  adapters.
- **`src/utils/data-input.ts`** — `loadDataFile(path)` now constructs
  and **returns** a fresh `StdinAdapter` instead of mutating a
  singleton.
- **`src/commands/query.ts`** — new internal
  `QueryOptions.stdinAdapter` field lets parent commands thread a
  shared adapter into sub-queries.
- **`src/commands/report.ts`**, **`src/commands/viz.ts`** — each entry
  point constructs one adapter and threads it through every
  sub-`runQuery(...)` call plus `generateReportGraphs(...)`.
- **`src/viz/embed.ts`** — `generateReportGraphs` now takes
  `{ stdinAdapter? }` and forwards to `viz()`.
- **`src/viz/types.ts`** — `VizOptions.stdinAdapter?` mirrors the
  `query` option for symmetry.

### Why

Before 0.9.0, concurrent or repeated `query()` / `report()` / `viz()`
calls within the same process would read or overwrite each other's
stdin payload via the module-scope adapter. Visible in long-running
programmatic consumers like scout-app (one Vercel warm instance serving
many requests); CLI one-shots were mostly unaffected because the
process died after every invocation.

### Tests

- `test/utils/data-input.test.ts` updated for the new `loadDataFile`
  return type.
- **New regression test** — asserts two back-to-back `loadDataFile`
  calls return independent adapter instances, the exact scenario the
  old singleton broke.

### Developer notes

- **Pre-existing Vega snapshot drift** in
  `test/viz/snapshots.test.ts > rolling chart` persists on `main`;
  unrelated to this change.
- **Groundwork for R5.0 (`ExecutionContext`)** — the `overrides` map on
  `resolveAdapters` is a natural inflection point for a full
  per-invocation context carrying cache/config/source policy alongside
  adapters.
- **scout-app migration** is a follow-up: bump its `bbdata` dep to
  `^0.9.0` and verify the prefetch path (no API change needed on its
  side because it calls `query()` / `report()` rather than importing
  `getStdinAdapter` directly).

### Also fixed

- **R1.2 (`report --data` still triggers network fetches for embedded
  graphs)** — closed as a side effect of this refactor. Both `--stdin`
  and `--data` now populate the same per-invocation `stdinAdapter` in
  `report()`, which is threaded through `generateReportGraphs` and
  every embedded `viz()` call. The prior bug was narrow (only `stdin`
  was forwarded to graph embedding); unifying both paths onto the
  adapter handle dissolved it.

- **R2.1 (source enable/disable config is ignored).** The config
  schema documented `sources.savant.enabled`, `sources.mlbStatsApi.enabled`,
  etc., but `query()` never consulted those toggles before
  `resolveAdapters()` — operators' config edits were silently no-ops.
  Now `query()` filters `template.preferredSources` through
  `isSourceEnabled(config, source)` and raises an actionable error when
  `--source <X>` names a disabled source. A new `SOURCE_CONFIG_KEYS`
  mapping bridges the kebab-case `DataSource` values (`mlb-stats-api`)
  to the camelCase config keys (`mlbStatsApi`) so both forms resolve to
  the same gate. `stdin` bypasses the check — it's a local data path,
  not a configurable network source. Covered by `test/config/sources.test.ts`.

- **R4.1 (lint / release hygiene broken).** `npm run lint` failed on any
  clean install because `eslint` was not declared in `devDependencies`,
  and the publish gate (`prepublishOnly`) didn't run lint at all — so
  style / safety regressions could ship unchecked. Fixed by adding
  `eslint@^10`, `@eslint/js@^10`, `typescript-eslint@^8` to
  `devDependencies`; adding a flat-config `eslint.config.js`
  (`eslint:recommended` + `typescript-eslint:recommended`, tuned to
  ignore `_`-prefixed unused bindings); and inserting `npm run lint`
  into the `prepublishOnly` chain between `build` and `typecheck`.
  Incidental fixes surfaced by the first clean lint pass: unused
  imports in 6 files (`FormattedOutput`, `gradeColor`, `QueryTemplateParams`,
  `pitchTypeName`, `DataSource`/`AdapterQuery`, `parse`); `_`-prefixed
  interface args on three adapter `fetch`/`supports` stubs and one
  template `transform`; `require('node:fs')` hoisted to a top-level
  import in `src/cache/store.ts`; unused `cmd` binding in
  `registerQueryCommand` inlined; unused `result` in
  `test/commands/query.test.ts` dropped; unnecessary escape in
  `src/viz/charts/rolling.ts` numeric-strip regex removed; and a
  `cause:` chain added to the rethrown parse error in
  `src/adapters/stdin.ts`.

- **R1.1 (caching is unimplemented despite public contract).** Before
  0.9.0, `query()` accepted `bypassCache` but adapters never consulted
  the cache, so `--no-cache`, `config.cache.enabled`, and
  `config.cache.maxAgeDays` were silent no-ops — every invocation hit
  upstream fresh despite the README (`README.md:187`) promising SQLite
  response caching. Now `query()` builds a per-invocation
  `CachePolicy { enabled, maxAgeDays }` and routes each adapter call
  through a new `fetchWithCache(adapter, query, policy)` wrapper
  (`src/cache/fetch-with-cache.ts`). On a cache hit the wrapper returns
  the stored `AdapterResult` with `cached: true` without calling
  the adapter; on a miss it calls the adapter with `bypassCache: true`
  (so adapters can't double-cache) and persists the serialized result
  via `setCache`. `stdin` is unconditionally excluded — it's a local
  in-memory path. Corrupt cache entries fall through to a fresh fetch;
  failed cache writes are swallowed as non-critical. Adapter `fetch()`
  contracts are unchanged — the cache is a per-invocation concern
  owned by the caller, mirroring the R1.3 `overrides` and R2.1
  `isSourceEnabled` patterns (groundwork for the R5.0
  `ExecutionContext`).

  Covered by 13 new wrapper tests (`test/cache/fetch-with-cache.test.ts`)
  for cold miss + write, warm hit, `fetchedAt` preservation, corrupt-
  JSON fallthrough, disabled policy, `stdin` exclusion, error
  propagation, and tolerance of a failing `setCache`; plus 3 integration
  tests in `test/commands/query.test.ts` proving the wiring honors
  `--no-cache`. Full suite: 251 / 251 green.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-04-14

**Package renamed from `bbdata-cli` to `bbdata`.** The binary name is unchanged
(`bbdata`) — this is purely an npm package-name rename so the install command,
the import specifier, and the binary finally match.

### Migration

```sh
npm uninstall bbdata-cli
npm install bbdata          # or: npm install -g bbdata
```

Programmatic consumers update their import specifier:

```diff
- import { query, report, viz } from 'bbdata-cli';
+ import { query, report, viz } from 'bbdata';
```

The old `bbdata-cli@0.7.2` package remains installable indefinitely — pinned
consumers (including historical scout-app builds in Vercel's immutable deploy
cache) will keep working. `bbdata-cli` will be `npm deprecate`d ~3 weeks after
0.8.0 ships; it will **not** be unpublished.

### Changed

- `package.json` `name` field: `bbdata-cli` → `bbdata`.
- `src/utils/version.ts` walk-up sentinel updated to match the new name.
- README, badges, and install/import examples updated to `bbdata`.

### Developer notes

- **No functional changes.** Every CLI flag, output schema, exported type,
  and adapter behavior is identical to 0.7.2. If you pin to `bbdata@0.8.0`
  today and later pin a fresh app to `bbdata-cli@0.7.2`, they will behave
  identically.

## 0.7.2 — 2026-04-14

Phase C of the TASKS.md backlog. Ships P3.4 — `--data <path>` file input.

### Added

- **`--data <path>` on `query`, `report`, and `viz`.** Loads a local `.json`
  or `.csv` file into the stdin adapter instead of fetching from the live
  APIs. Dispatches by extension — `.json` uses the same shape as piped
  `--stdin` (raw array or `{ data: [...], player?: {...} }`); `.csv` is
  parsed with the Savant search-CSV schema, so any CSV exported from
  Savant's search tool round-trips cleanly. Useful for students iterating
  on the same dataset repeatedly and for offline / sandboxed environments.
- **Shared Savant CSV parser — `src/adapters/savant-csv.ts`.** Exports
  `parseSavantCsv(csvText): PitchData[]`. Now used by both the Savant HTTP
  adapter (previously inlined the map) and the `--data *.csv` path, so
  the field map stays field-for-field in sync.
- **`StdinAdapter.loadRecords(data, player?)`.** Skips JSON.parse when the
  caller already has typed records — the CSV path doesn't round-trip
  through serialization.

### Changed

- **`src/adapters/savant.ts` refactored** to call `parseSavantCsv`. No
  behavior change; the CSV filter (empty `pitch_type`, non-`R` `game_type`)
  and column map are identical to the prior inline implementation.
- **`--stdin` and `--data` are mutually exclusive.** Passing both exits
  with `Pass only one of --stdin or --data <path>, not both.`
- **Unsupported file extensions** (anything other than `.json` / `.csv`)
  produce `Unsupported --data extension "<ext>". Use .json or .csv.` —
  no silent guessing.

### Developer notes

- **Test coverage.** +7 cases in `test/utils/data-input.test.ts`: CSV→
  PitchData map including zero-preservation on count fields; `.json`
  wrapper + raw-array shapes; `.csv` end-to-end through the adapter;
  unsupported-extension error; case-insensitive extension match. Vitest
  runs 228/228 green (was 221).
- **README.md** adds `--data <path>` to the query flag table.

## 0.7.1 — 2026-04-14

Phase B of the TASKS.md backlog. Ships P3.1 — `--format pdf`.

### Added

- **P3.1 — `--format pdf` on `viz`.** New `specToPdf(svg, { width, height, mode, dpi })`
  in `src/viz/render.ts`. Two modes:
  - **`vector` (default)** — embeds the SVG natively via `svg-to-pdfkit`.
    Scalable, small file, crisp at any zoom. Pages are sized to chart
    dimensions (PDF points 1:1 with CSS pixels → an 800×500 chart becomes an
    ~11"×7" page).
  - **`raster`** — rasterizes via `@resvg/resvg-js`, then wraps the PNG as a
    full-page PDF image. Visually identical to the PNG output. Use when
    `svg-to-pdfkit` misrenders complex Vega output (gradients, paint-order
    halos, nested clipPaths). `--dpi` scales the intermediate raster;
    default 192 (2× baseline).
- **`--pdf-mode <vector|raster>` flag** on the viz command, paired with
  `--dpi` for the raster path.
- **Dependencies:** `pdfkit ^0.18.0`, `svg-to-pdfkit ^0.1.8`, plus the
  matching `@types/*` in dev.

### Changed

- **TTY binary guard extended to PDF.** The existing PNG guard at the
  stdout-to-terminal boundary (`viz.ts`) now also catches PDF, with a
  format-specific error message.
- **`viz` command help text** lists `pdf` in the `--format` enum and shows
  a `--format pdf` example.

### Developer notes

- **Test coverage.** +6 new cases in `test/viz/pdf.test.ts`: each of the 4
  shipped chart types through the vector path, plus two raster cases
  (default dpi and dpi-scales-up-file). Vitest runs 221/221 green (was 213).
  The raster suite has a 30s timeout because resvg's first-call font init
  on Windows can take 5–10s.
- **No breaking changes.** `--format pdf` is additive; all prior flags and
  defaults are unchanged.
- **Fallback rationale.** Vega-Lite emits SVG with features (complex
  gradients used by zone/heatmap color scales, `paint-order` on text halos
  post-processed in by `ensureTextPaintOrder`, nested clipPaths on
  faceted panels) that `svg-to-pdfkit` handles imperfectly in some cases.
  Shipping both paths avoids the trap of discovering per-chart breakage
  late. Vector is the default because it preserves scalability.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-04-14

Phase A of the post-audit TASKS.md backlog. Closes the gap between what the
Baseball AI Community course's Module 04 deliverables promise and what `bbdata`
ships on the output-format, rolling-window, chart-alias, and audience fronts.
No breaking changes to existing CLI callers — every new behavior is opt-in via
a new flag or an alias.

### Added

- **P1.1 — `--format png` on `viz`.** `@resvg/resvg-js` promoted from
  `devDependencies` to `dependencies`; the rasterizer helper moved from
  `test/helpers/rasterize.ts` to `src/viz/rasterize.ts` (both production
  scripts that already used it — `render-fixtures.ts`, `extract-report-assets.ts`
  — updated to the new import path). The `viz` command now branches on
  `--format` at `src/commands/viz.ts` and writes a PNG binary when requested.
  Binary output to a TTY is refused with a hint to use `--output` or a pipe.
- **P3.2 — `--format html`.** New `specToHtml()` in `src/viz/render.ts` wraps
  the rendered SVG in a minimal standalone HTML document and embeds the source
  Vega-Lite spec as a `<script type="application/json" id="bbdata-spec">` block
  so downstream tooling can re-extract it without re-running the CLI. Tags
  inside the spec are escaped (`</script>` → `\u003c/script>`) so an
  adversarial spec can't break out of the script block.
- **P3.3 — `--dpi <n>` flag.** Only meaningful for raster output. Computes the
  raster width as `round(chartWidth × dpi / 96)`, so `--dpi 300` on an 800px
  chart produces a 2500px PNG. Falls back to 2× chart width when omitted.
- **P1.3 — `--window <n>` flag on `viz rolling`.** Threads through
  `VizOptions` → `QueryOptions` → `QueryTemplateParams` → the
  `trend-rolling-average` template's `transform()`. The template now reads
  `params.window ?? 15` at the previously hard-coded line (registry.ts
  carries a new optional `window` field to keep the type honest). The course's
  `--window 5` example on `Modules/04/Deliverables/Visualization Template
  Library.md:466` now works end-to-end.
- **P1.2(b) — Chart-type aliases.** `src/viz/charts/index.ts` adds a unidirectional
  alias map: `pitching-movement → movement`, `hitting-spray → spray`,
  `hitting-zones → zone`, `trend-rolling → rolling`. Resolved via new
  `resolveChartType()` before the registry lookup. `listChartAliases()`
  exposes the map so the CLI help text and `viz` sans-args listing show
  both canonical and aliased names. Chose this over the course rewrite
  because it unblocks existing course commands without touching the course.
- **`src/viz/rasterize.ts`** (promoted from `test/helpers/`). Same surface,
  same defaults (`width: 1600`, `background: '#ffffff'`, system fonts
  loaded). Tuned for the assistant's PNG-via-Read-tool workflow.

### Changed

- **P4.3 — `--audience` enum harmonized across `viz` and `report`.** The two
  commands used disjoint vocabularies (`coach|gm|scout|analyst` for report;
  `coach|analyst|frontoffice|presentation` for viz). New
  `resolveReportAudience()` in `src/commands/report.ts` accepts the superset
  at the CLI boundary and normalizes `presentation → analyst`,
  `frontoffice → gm` before the template resolution. `ReportOptions.audience`
  widened to `Audience | VizAudience | string` with a safe fallback to
  `analyst` for typos. The report-template `audiences: Audience[]` arrays
  are untouched — the harmonization is a CLI-boundary normalizer, not a type
  widening, to keep the blast radius small.
- **`viz` command help text** rewritten to surface chart aliases and the new
  `--format`, `--dpi`, `--window` flags. `bbdata viz` with no type argument
  now prints both the canonical chart list and the alias map.

### Developer notes

- **No breaking changes.** Every new flag is optional with a back-compatible
  default. Programmatic callers of `viz()` / `report()` that don't pass the
  new options see identical behavior to 0.6.1.
- **Test coverage.** 6 new cases in `test/commands/viz.test.ts` (PNG branch,
  HTML branch, DPI scaling, `--window` thread-through, alias resolution,
  unsupported-format rejection) + 3 new cases in `test/viz/render.test.ts`
  for `specToHtml` + a new `test/viz/rasterize.test.ts` smoke suite. `npm test`
  green at 213 tests (was 207).
- **`test/helpers/rasterize.ts` deleted.** No test imports it; the two
  production scripts that did are updated to `src/viz/rasterize.js`.
- **package.json dependency move** is the one change that touches the
  release-sensitive surface. Run `npm install` once before `npm version`
  to re-sort `package-lock.json` — `npm version` itself won't reorder deps.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-04-10

### Added

- **`pro-hitter-eval` now populates Splits Analysis and Rolling Trend sections.** Previously two `*To be populated*` placeholder stubs, the template now renders (a) a handedness splits table (vs LHP / vs RHP) and (b) a five-panel rolling performance chart (AVG, SLG, K%, Avg EV, Hard Hit %) embedded alongside the existing Trend Analysis table. Both sections degrade gracefully via `{{#if}}{{else}}` when source data is empty. Validated end-to-end against Aaron Judge 2025 (elite RH full season), Gerrit Cole 2025 (pitcher regression check), and Roman Anthony 2025 (LH rookie mid-season callup).
- **New query template `hitter-handedness-splits`** (`src/templates/queries/hitter-handedness-splits.ts`). Filters Statcast batting rows by `p_throws` (pitcher handedness — *not* `stand`, which is the batter's side), labels each row vs LHP / vs RHP, and returns `stat_type: 'batting'`. Self-registers via side-effect import. 7 unit tests including an explicit assertion that the filter uses `p_throws` and not `stand`, since the two columns look interchangeable at a glance but quietly return the wrong handedness's splits if swapped.
- **`rollingChart` slot on `pro-hitter-eval`.** `src/viz/embed.ts` now routes `trend-rolling-average` query output through the existing `rollingBuilder` into a new slot consumed by the template.
- **`scripts/extract-report-assets.ts`** — reusable preview script. Takes a markdown file from `.reports/`, extracts inline `<svg>` blocks, rasterizes each via the same `rasterizeSvg` helper used by `render-fixtures.ts`, and writes `<slug>-chart-<N>.png` adjacent to the source. Closes the live-data feedback loop the way `viz:fixtures` closes the synthetic-data loop. Usage: `npx tsx scripts/extract-report-assets.ts <file.md>`.

### Changed

- **`pro-hitter-eval` data requirements grew from 3 queries to 5.** The template now additionally fetches `hitter-handedness-splits` and `trend-rolling-average`. Both new queries are marked `required: false` so a failure in either degrades gracefully rather than blocking the whole report.
- **`test/templates/registry.test.ts`** — expected template count bumped from 15 to 16 to account for the new `hitter-handedness-splits` registration.

### Developer notes

- **No breaking changes** to CLI surface, programmatic API, or output format.
- **Consumers of `pro-hitter-eval` (notably `scout-app`)** will see richer output automatically — no code changes required on their side. `scout-app/src/lib/bbdata.ts` spawns a fresh Node subprocess per request via `execFile`, so the new version takes effect as soon as `npm install bbdata-cli@0.4.0` is run there; no dev-server restart needed.

### Release checklist (for maintainers)

1. `npm run viz:fixtures` — regenerate fixture PNGs, visually sanity-check each chart builder
2. `npx tsx scripts/extract-report-assets.ts pro-hitter-eval_judge_2025.md` — visual verification on a live report
3. `npm run build && npm run typecheck && npm test` — all clean (also runs automatically via `prepublishOnly`)
4. Update this file with the release date
5. `npm publish`
6. `git tag v0.4.0 && git push --tags`
7. In `scout-app`: `npm install bbdata-cli@0.4.0`, then visual verification at `localhost:3000/chat`

## 0.3.0 — 2026-04-10

### Fixed

- **Zone chart cell labels are now readable.** The text-halo rule (`paint-order: stroke`) was correctly specified in the Vega-Lite spec, but Vega's Node SVG serializer silently dropped the attribute, leaving numeric xwOBA labels rendered as ghosted near-invisible text over dark-red MVP-tier cells. `specToSvg()` now post-processes the output to inject `paint-order="stroke"` on any text element that has both `fill` and `stroke`. All charts rendered via bbdata — including `bbdata report pro-hitter-eval` embeds consumed by `scout-app` — inherit the fix automatically.

### Added

- **Visual test harness.** `npm run viz:fixtures` renders each of the four chart types (movement, spray, zone, rolling) from fixture JSON into both `.svg` and `.png` files under `.reports/fixtures/`, using `@resvg/resvg-js` as the rasterizer. This closes the feedback loop for chart development — you (or the assistant) can inspect the PNGs directly instead of regenerating and previewing markdown.
- **Snapshot + structural tests** for all four chart builders (`test/viz/snapshots.test.ts`). In addition to SVG snapshots (normalized for stable diffing), explicit assertions cover:
  - Zone cell labels carry `paint-order="stroke"` (regression test for the bug above)
  - Zone cell label text content matches fixture xwOBA values to 3 decimals (accuracy check)
  - Zone color scale uses `redyellowblue` reverse, domain `[0.2, 0.5]`, clamp enabled
  - Rolling chart uses faceted small multiples with `resolve.scale.y === 'independent'` (prevents anyone from reverting to shared-axis which would squash mixed-unit metrics)
  - All charts: title, axis labels, non-zero viewBox
- **New fixture** `test/fixtures/viz/zone-grid.sample.json` — 9-cell Judge-ish grid spanning ~.190 to ~.705 so snapshots exercise both the clamp endpoints and the readable mid-range.
- **`ensureTextPaintOrder()`** helper exported from `src/viz/render.ts` for advanced consumers who want to apply the same post-process to externally-serialized Vega output.
- **`prepublishOnly` hook** runs `build`, `typecheck`, and `test` before any `npm publish` attempt. Lint is intentionally skipped — the existing `lint` script has no ESLint config at the repo root and errors out on a clean checkout, which is a pre-existing issue unrelated to this release and should be fixed separately.

### Developer notes

- `@resvg/resvg-js` is a devDependency only — no change to the published runtime surface of `bbdata-cli`. If shipping `--format png` becomes useful later, the rasterizer helper at `test/helpers/rasterize.ts` can be promoted to `src/viz/`.
- No breaking changes to CLI, programmatic API, or output format.

### Release checklist (for maintainers)

2. `npm run build && npm run typecheck && npm test` — all clean
3. Update this file with the release date
4. `npm publish`
5. `git tag v0.3.0 && git push --tags`
